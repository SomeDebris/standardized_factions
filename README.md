# Standardized Factions

(Now compatible with Campaign Mode!)

The purpose of this mod is to make every faction competitively viable while maintaining each of the factions unique, internal balances. Where other mods look to achieve balance through statistical changes, this mod instead uses whole faction cost modifiers.

## FAQ:

Q: Why does everything cost so much?
A: Everything's cost is x10 on top of the whole faction cost modifiers to minimize rounding errors that would result from dividing lower costing parts.

Q: Why didn't you just give the weaker factions more P towards their fleet size?
A: If we opted for that, we couldnâ€™t have had balanced, mixed faction fleets.
